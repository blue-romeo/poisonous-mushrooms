# Mushroom Classification Project
## Objective:
This project aims to develop a machine-learning model that accurately classifies mushrooms as poisonous or edible based on their observed characteristics.

## Data:
The dataset used for this project is the Mushroom Classification Dataset from the Kaggle Playground competition. It contains features such as cap shape, color, gills, stalk, stem height, and a target variable indicating whether the mushroom is poisonous or edible.

## Methodology:

### Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values.
Convert categorical features to numerical representations ie frequency encoding
Normalize or standardize numerical features.
### Feature Selection:
Used all the features to avoid losing important information
### Model Training:
Used lightgboost as a faster alternative to xgboost.
trained, fitted, and made predictions for the data
### Model Evaluation:
Use appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) to assess the model's performance.
Constructed a confusion matrix and plotted a heatmap to check for overfitting
### submission
submitted the output to the competition


## Future Work:

Explore more advanced techniques like deep learning for improved performance.
Consider incorporating domain knowledge to enhance feature engineering.
Develop a user-friendly interface for interacting with the model.
